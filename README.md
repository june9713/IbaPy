This project is analysis ".dat file" structure to use Iba Analyzer without IBA PDA.
https://www.iba-ag.com/en/germany/products/
IBA PDA provide very flexible and powerful way for data analysisng with Iba Analyzer.
IBA PDA is gether huge amount of datas via many kind of ways(ethernet, serial, optic etc...) and Iba Analyzer 
visualize data with easy, powerful and flexible way.
You can compare many of signals in one graph,and you can use filter or fft and
very much of tools for data analysis.
But, IBA Analyzer can open only ".dat file" that generated by IBA PDA.
If you can generate ".dat file" as same structure with IBA PDA, you can use IBA Anlyzer to visualize your own datas.
You can find many of free data visualizing application on the web, but I think Iba Analyzer is most powerful tool for you.
